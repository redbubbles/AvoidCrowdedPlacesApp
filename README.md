# BudgetManagementMobileApp

Budget Management is a mobile application meant to help its users to better keep track of their incomes and expenses.
It is designed to make it easy for the user to manage his money, allowing him to add new departements(such as pet food) besides those already existing. The user is able to add repeatable incomes and expenses. It is useful because he can be notified when a bill is about to come(Internet bill- monthly) or when he is about to receive his salary etc.
